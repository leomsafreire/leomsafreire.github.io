I'm currently Head of Football Analytics at <a href='https://twitter.com/atletico/'>Clube Atlético Mineiro</a>. Leading the Football Analytics Department, I manage the club’s entire football data journey — from raw ingestion to advanced reporting. We handle granular, high-resolution datasets as well as data generated by the club’s own processes, building in-house models and frameworks that support recruitment, strategy, and performance analysis.

Currently pursuing a MSc in Computer Science at <a href='https://ufmg.br/'>UFMG</a>, I am also a researcher at the <a href='https://salabufmg.github.io'>Sports Analytics Lab</a>. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Pure Mathematics, also from UFMG.
